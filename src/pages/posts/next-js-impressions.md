I’m trying to keep up with most of React hype. And recently Zeit.co (now <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-teal-500 no-underline hover:underline">Vercel</a>)
was in the news so I decided to see what is happening. I try to use new software for any small project
I have :), so far I tried React-Static, CRA and Next.js including few others that I didn’t like how they
looked or worked. And while overall I think Next.js is structured pretty sensibly I didn't like the fact
that it’s vendor locked and I wasn't able to start it up with Netlify.
