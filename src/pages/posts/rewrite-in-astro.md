Recently I've been interested in new JavaScript frameworks. The ones that got
most of my attention were [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Astro](https://astro.build/),
and [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/).

We now use Solid on production. I'm still yet to try Qwik, but I used Astro a
few times. And I liked it, so I ditched my next.js blog and wrote it in Astro
instead. I also had a chance to play with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/)
which allowed me to keep my 99 lighthouse score even with analytics turned on.
