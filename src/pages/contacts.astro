        <p class="py-2">Hi!</p>
        <p class="py-2">
            On most things on the internet I have nick <b>JLarky</b> or{' '}
            <b>jlarky2012</b> (it was funnier before the end of the world
            happened, I should have used jlarky2020). But my real name is Yaroslav
            Ivanovich Lapin (Ярослав Иванович Лапин), I was born in USSR and lived
            most of my live in Russia but last few years I live in USA. I rarely
            care about updating this kind of information on social networks, so
            this is going to go stale at some point as well :)
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            I care about some people, games and programming. Lately I mostly code
            in React/TypeScript and Elixir.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2" title={lastModified}>
            Right at this moment
            ({
            <Date dateString={lastModified} />}) I would say
            that best way to reach me is Telegram or Twitter. But I have some
            other links that I'm going to add here in time :)
        </p>
